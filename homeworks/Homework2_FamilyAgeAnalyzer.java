/**
 * HOMEWORK 2: Family Age Analyzer
 * PT821 - Object-Oriented Programming
 * Due Date: [Set by Instructor]
 *
 * ============================================================
 * INSTRUCTIONS (READ CAREFULLY):
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Create a program that analyzes YOUR REAL family members' ages.
 * This homework CANNOT be copied because it uses YOUR family data.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 1. Use REAL ages of at least 5 family members (parents, siblings, etc.)
 * 2. Use REAL names of your family members
 * 3. Include yourself in the analysis
 * 4. You must be able to explain your family structure if asked
 *
 * TASK:
 * Create a program that:
 * a) Stores names and ages of 5+ family members in arrays
 * b) Calculates the average age of your family
 * c) Finds the oldest and youngest family member
 * d) Calculates the age difference between oldest and youngest
 * e) Counts how many family members are above/below average age
 * f) Determines if YOU are above or below family average
 * g) Uses loops for ALL calculations (no hardcoding results)
 *
 * EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
 * ================================================
 * FAMILY AGE ANALYSIS REPORT
 * Student: [Your Name] - [Your Reg Number]
 * ================================================
 * Family Members:
 * 1. [Name] - Age: XX (Relationship: Father)
 * 2. [Name] - Age: XX (Relationship: Mother)
 * ... (continue for all members)
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Total family members: X
 * Average family age: XX.XX years
 * Oldest: [Name] (XX years)
 * Youngest: [Name] (XX years)
 * Age gap: XX years
 * Members above average: X
 * Members below average: X
 * I am [ABOVE/BELOW] the family average
 * ================================================
 *
 * GRADING CRITERIA:
 * - Correct use of arrays (20%)
 * - Correct loop implementations (25%)
 * - Accurate calculations (25%)
 * - Use of YOUR real family data (30%)
 *
 * WARNING: You may be asked to verify family information verbally.
